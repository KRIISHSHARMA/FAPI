## 1.1 5G NR

-  FAPI is an interface, which defines the interface between MAC-Layer#2 and PHY â€“ Layer#1 for small cells.

- Figure consists of 5 Core (AMF,UPF,etc.) and gNB
- 5G FAPI resides within the gNB element .
- Interfaces in 5G network (NG , Xn and F1)
- [NG interface](https://www.rfwireless-world.com/Tutorials/5G-NR-network-interfaces.html#:~:text=5G%20NR%20F1%20Interface&text=%E2%80%A2-,Functions%3A,Layer%20and%20Transport%20Network%20Layer.) : The NG (Next Generation) interface in the context of 5G refers to the interface between the Next Generation Core (NGC) and the Radio Access Network (RAN)
- [Xn interface](https://www.rfwireless-world.com/Tutorials/5G-NR-network-interfaces.html#:~:text=5G%20NR%20F1%20Interface&text=%E2%80%A2-,Functions%3A,Layer%20and%20Transport%20Network%20Layer.) : exists between these base stations viz. between gNB-gNB, between (gNB)-(ng-eNB) and between (ng-eNB)-(ng-eNB).
- [F1 interface](https://www.rfwireless-world.com/Tutorials/5G-NR-network-interfaces.html#:~:text=5G%20NR%20F1%20Interface&text=%E2%80%A2-,Functions%3A,Layer%20and%20Transport%20Network%20Layer.) :  defines inter-connection of a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU supplied by different manufacturers.
- [F2 interface](https://www.rfwireless-world.com/Tutorials/5G-NR-network-interfaces.html#:~:text=5G%20NR%20F1%20Interface&text=%E2%80%A2-,Functions%3A,Layer%20and%20Transport%20Network%20Layer.) : This interface lies between lower and upper parts of the 5G NR physical layer. It is also separated into F2-C and F2-U based on control plane and user plane functionalities.

- For 5G FAPI the MAC and PHY reside is a single element, resulting in FAPI existing as an internal interface within the gNB as shown below

## 1.2 PHY API

- Both control- and data-plane information is passed through the PHY API. However, each API message contains either control- or data-plane information, but never both.

- Below is an example of how the different L2/L3 protocol layer will interact with the PHY API . in the example given below a PHY control entity is responsible for configuration procedures (P5). The MAC layer is responsible for the exchange of data-plane messages with the PHY (P7).
-  The PHY configuration sent over the P5 interface may be determined using SON techniques, information model parameters sent from an OAM system, or a combination of both methods. If carrier aggregation is supported, then one instance of the PHY API exists for each component carrier, as defined in 3GPP TS 38.104 [7].
  - [SON technique](https://www.snstelecom.com/son) : SON (Self-Organizing Network) technology is like a smart system for mobile networks. It helps save money by getting rid of the need for people to manually set up and manage the network. From the beginning, when the network is first set up, all the way through its operation, SON takes care of things like adjusting and fixing issues without needing constant human intervention. This not only makes the network work better for users but also makes it cheaper for the companies running the mobile network, helping them save money and improve their overall financial situation.
 - [OAM system](https://www.zte.com.cn/global/about/magazine/zte-technologies/2021/2-en/special-topic/6.html) : OAM technology is used to collect statistics on quality data such as packet loss, delay and jitter of traffic streams

- There are two types of PHY  configuration messages are defined by the logical interface as P5 and P7
- P5 Logical Interface is  for PHY control configuration which is semi-static and is being generated by a PHY control entity.
- The P7 logical interface is for PHY data plane messages, P7 interface data configuration is generated once per slot and consists of following:
  - Slot configuration messages, which include information required by the PHY to encode and decode data
  - Downlink data messages to transfer **MAC PDUs to the PHY.**
  - Uplink data messages to transfer **MAC PDUs, Uplink Control Information ,Sounding Reference Signal and RACH PDUs from the PHY**
